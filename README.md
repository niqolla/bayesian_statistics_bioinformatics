# 1 - Generala

1. Write a function that takes a number of dices and returns all the possible outcomes
for that amount of dice.

2. Write functions that return, given five dice, True or False if we have Straight, Full,
Poker, or Generala.

3. Compute the probabilities that you already computed by hand by counting the
outcomes describing each roll result in the list of all possible hands served (1st roll).

4. Write a function that simulates a roll with n fair dice.

5. Write a function that plays automatically (max 3 rolls), always looking for a Generala
with a greedy strategy (always keeping the most dices of the same kind and rolling
the others) that returns True if we get a Generala and a False otherwise. Which kind
of distribution follows this function results? Explain your reasoning within the
delivered python notebook.

6. Write a function that plays until it gets a Generala, count how many times it had to
play to get it, and return this number. Which kind of distribution follows this function
results? Explain your reasoning within the delivered python notebook.

# 2 - Gene Expression 

Healthy vs Cancer gene expression

We are performing a study on classical cancer marker genes to know if they influence the
proliferation rate of cells. We follow the division time of healthy and cancer cells and
afterward we perform a proteomic study to see these candidate marker genes' expression.

1. Propose a threshold to classify the cells as "healthy" and "cancer" cells. Perform a t-test to
indicate the significance of your conclusions. Explain carefully what a t-test is and the
conclusions that you have drawn.

2. Construct a model (or more than one) in PyMC3 to test the influence of these marker
genes in proliferation. Try to catch which genes influence and which ones do not, which ones
"trigger" the doubling time when some threshold is surpassed, etc. Explain carefully the
model(s) and your conclusions
