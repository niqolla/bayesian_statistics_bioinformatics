# 1 - Generala

1. Write a function that takes a number of dices and returns all the possible outcomes
for that amount of dice.

2. Write functions that return, given five dice, True or False if we have Straight, Full,
Poker, or Generala.

3. Compute the probabilities that you already computed by hand by counting the
outcomes describing each roll result in the list of all possible hands served (1st roll).

4. Write a function that simulates a roll with n fair dice.

5. Write a function that plays automatically (max 3 rolls), always looking for a Generala
with a greedy strategy (always keeping the most dices of the same kind and rolling
the others) that returns True if we get a Generala and a False otherwise. Which kind
of distribution follows this function results? Explain your reasoning within the
delivered python notebook.

6. Write a function that plays until it gets a Generala, count how many times it had to
play to get it, and return this number. Which kind of distribution follows this function
results? Explain your reasoning within the delivered python notebook.
